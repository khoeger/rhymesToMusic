\section{Motivation}
When working on an data sonification, I wanted to algorihtmically assign input data to certain output notes. 
The input dataset was a discrete set of values and the expected output was another discrete set of values. 
Each individual element of a dataset has a frequency of occurrence within the set. 
After figuring out the frequency of occurrences of elements for each respective set, the goal was as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Map elements of the input data set to the output data set in such a way that as much of the input data set as possible  is proportionally mapped into the output data set, and the output data set's frequencies of occurrences are as close to the actual representation as possible. 
\end{itemize}
