      " |      Flattening a stream is a great way to get at all the notes in\n",

      " |      0\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      This is because all the notes in the piece lie within :class:`music21.stream.Measure`\n",
      " |      objects and those measures lie within :class:`music21.stream.Part`\n",
      " |      objects.  It'd be a pain to navigate all the way through all those\n",
      " |      objects just to count notes.  Fortunately we can get a Stream of\n",
      " |      all the notes in the piece with .flat.notes and then use the\n",
      " |      length of that Stream to count notes:\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      >>> bwv66flat = bwv66.flat\n",

      " |      (the second note of part1).  This is because the flat stream\n",
      " |      is automatically sorted like all streams are by default.  The\n",

      " |      We can get at the notes by using the indices of the\n",

      " |      \n",
      " |      Flattening a stream is a great way to get at all the notes in\n",
      " |      a larger piece.  For instance if we load a four-part\n",
      " |      Bach chorale into music21 from the integrated corpus, it\n",

      " |      0\n",
      " |      \n",
      " |      This is because all the notes in the piece lie within :class:`music21.stream.Measure`\n",
      " |      objects and those measures lie within :class:`music21.stream.Part`\n",
      " |      objects.  It'd be a pain to navigate all the way through all those\n",
      " |      objects just to count notes.  Fortunately we can get a Stream of\n",
      " |      all the notes in the piece with .flat.notes and then use the\n",
      " |      length of that Stream to count notes:\n",
      " |      \n",

      " |      you can see that the E (the first note in part2) comes before the D\n",
      " |      (the second note of part1).  This is because the flat stream\n",
