The most unfortunate encounters are like those with fish bones.
The longer the encounter, the more the fishy smell sticks with you.

The encounters to be most careful with
are with an open bloom, because
while itâ€™s open it brings cheers of joy, but
as it wilts, it gets thrown away.

The most beautiful encounters are like those with handkerchiefs.
They wipe away your sweat when you are tired, and your tears when you are sad.
